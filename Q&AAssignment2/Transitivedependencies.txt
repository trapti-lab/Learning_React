what is transitive dependency npm?
We have package manager which handles the transitive dependencies.
transitive dependencies : Whenever we are building production ready app we requries some bundler which takes take of
minification,HMR,Port handling, browser compatiblility and everything so we are just installing one bulnder 
which inside has several node modules(package that cares of everything).So bunlder depends on these package to make our 
app production ready also these package might depend on other packages.So this is known as transitive dependencies
Dependency of one package on other package(in case of parcel it will creates the tree of dependencies of package it will be dependent on).
