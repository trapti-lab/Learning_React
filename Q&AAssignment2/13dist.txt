What is the `dist` folder?
When we create build of our project with npx parcel build index.html 
parcel creates the build and keep the build files(mainly index.js,index.html,index.css)  in the .dist folder (it has all the files in minified version,
lot more like tree shaking,Image optimization,Development branch removal,Compression etc.)
