What is `.parcel-cache`?

Caching
Parcel caches everything it builds to disk. If you restart the dev server, Parcel will only rebuild files that have 
changed since the last time it ran. Parcel automatically tracks all of the files, configuration, plugins, and dev
 dependencies that are involved in your build, and granularly invalidates the cache when something changes. 
 For example, if you change a configuration file, all of the source files that rely on that configuration will be 
 rebuilt.

By default, the cache is stored in the .parcel-cache folder inside your project. You should add this folder to your
 .gitignore (or equivalent) so that it is not committed in your repo. You can also override the location of the 
 cache using the --cache-dir CLI option.

Caching can also be disabled using the --no-cache flag. Note that this only disables reading from the cache â€“ a 
.parcel-cache folder will still be created.

//To perform parcel  all it functionality like minification,HMR everything it needs some space so in parcel.cache
it does everything 

//Anything which is autogenerated should not keep in gitignore so **parcel.cache should keep in the gitignore**.
