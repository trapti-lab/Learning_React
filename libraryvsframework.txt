Difference between library and framework?
Framework and libraries are code written by third party
to solve/common problem or to optimise performance.
A key Difference between library and framework is inversion of
control.When using library the control remains to the developer
who tells the application when to call the library function.
But in framework, the control is inverted i.e. the framework calls us. 
It defines a skeleton where the application defines its own features to fill out the skeleton.

 
             Framework                                        Library
1)It comprises lot of APIs,compilers,support           1)It is collection of helper modules,classes,
 program,libraries etc.                                     functions,pre-written code etc.
2)It is difficult to replace to framework.             2)It is easier to replace to library.
3)A framework developement required lots of            3)Building Library requires less code,so there is  
code that decereases perfomance and increases            better performance and fast load time.
the load time.
4)Including framework in existing code is              4)Libraries can be integrated easily to existing project
impossible.                                                to add some specific functionalities.
Ex: Angularjs                                           Ex: Reactjs
