What is crossorigin in script tag?
The crossorigin attribute, valid on the <audio>, <img>, <link>, <script>, and <video> elements, 
provides support for CORS, defining how the element handles cross-origin requests, 
thereby enabling the configuration of the CORS requests for the element's fetched data. 
Depending on the element, the attribute can be a CORS settings attribute.

The crossorigin content attribute on media elements is a CORS settings attribute.

These attributes are enumerated, and have the following possible values:

anonymous
Request uses CORS headers and credentials flag is set to 'same-origin'. 
There is no exchange of user credentials via cookies, client-side SSL certificates or HTTP authentication, 
unless destination is the same origin.

use-credentials
Request uses CORS headers, credentials flag is set to 'include' and user credentials are always included.

""
Setting the attribute name to an empty value, like crossorigin or crossorigin="", is the same as anonymous.
