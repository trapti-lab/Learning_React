What is async and defer?
Default - By default, as soon as the browser sees a script tag it downloads the file and 
then executes the script file. The script files are executed in the order of their occurrence.

async - The browser will download the script file and continue parsing HTML parallelly until the file is downloaded.
The file is executed as soon as it is downloaded.

defer - The browser will download the script and do HTML parsing at the same time. After parsing is done, 
the script files are executed in the order of their occurrence.

Note: In defer, the js files are executed in the order of their occurrence in the HTML file while in the 
case of the async attribute the script files are executed in the order of download time.
