What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?

The development build is used - as the name suggests - for development reasons. You have Source Maps, debugging 
and often times hot reloading ability in those builds.

The production build, on the other hand, runs in production mode which means this is the code running on 
your client's machine. The production build runs uglify and builds your source files into one or multiple minimized 
files. It also extracts CSS and images and of course any other sources you're loading with Webpack. There's also no
hot reloading included. Source Maps might be included as separate files depending on your webpack devtool settings.
